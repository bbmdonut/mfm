mfm_emu emulates a MFM disk drive. It can use a data file created
from a real drive by mfm_read or can create a empty emulation file.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--begin_time -b #</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in">The number of
nanoseconds to delay from index to start reading track Only needed if
initialize specified. Default is zero if not specified.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--cylinders  -c #</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; background: transparent; page-break-before: auto">
The number of cylinders. Only needed if initialize specified.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--drive  -d #[,#]</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Drive number to
emulate. For revision B or C boards specify 0 or 1 or 1,2.  1 and 2
select the first and second jumper block to use for drive select. One
or two drive numbers may be specified to emulate one or two drives.
Use 0 for drive to always be selected (radial select). Very few
systems use 0 so you likely don’t want to use 0. Only one number
may be used if drive number is 0. For revision A boards specify the
drive number to emulate 1-4.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">First drive
specified uses J1. The second uses J6.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--file -f filename[,filename]</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Emulation filename.
First filename corresponds to first drive number specified.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--heads  -h #</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">The number of
heads. Only needed if initialize specified.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--initialize[=controller]
-i[controller]</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">If given
create/overwrite specified file with empty data. Heads and cylinders
must be specified. Takes optional argument controller which current
valid values of Cromemco and Default. Cromemco needs special format
for STDC controller to format image. Controller is case insensitive.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--note -n “string”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Description to
store in the emulation file. Only used if initialize specified.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--options -o “string”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in">Options for
mfm_util in decoding such as –data_crc. This saves having to type
each time you wish to decode file. Only used if initialize specified
and not required. No validation is performed so use mfm_util to
verify file is valid after creating.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--pool -p #,#.#</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in">The first
parameter is the size of the of track buffer pool to use. and the
second is the maximum delay. The delay will increase linearly as the
buffers fill to the maximum delay. Default is 75,0.6</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--quiet  -q #h</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Bit mask to select
which messages don't print. 0 prints all messages. Default is 1 (no
debug messages). Higher bits are more important messages in general.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--rate -r #</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in">Bit rate in Hz for
the MFM clock and data bits. Only needed if initialize specified.
Default is 10,000,000. if not specified. For most SA1000 controllers
specify 8680000. Only needed when –initialize specified.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--rpm -R #</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in">Drive RPM. Default
is 3600 unless rate is close to 8680000 where the default is 3125 for
SA1000 drives. For Quantum Q2000 drives specify 3000 if you wish to
emulate the real drive RPM. Only needed when –initialize specified.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--sync</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in">Opens emulator
file with O_DSYNC to flush data to disk after write. With hold up
capacitors and powerfail shouldn’t be needed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">--version -v</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Print program
version number.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Long options can be abbreviated to the
shortest unique name. Long option values can't have spaces.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"># is a number. #h is a number which may
be decimal, octal if starts with a 0, or hex starting with 0x.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"> 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The buffer pool option controls
buffering used to prevent controller timeouts when writing data to
the file. Writing to flash has large delays at times which the
buffers hide. The maximum delay should be set shorter than the
controller timeout for a seek. The maximum number of buffers needs to
be low enough that they can be written out before the holdup
capacitors are drained.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Begin_time is for drives that have a
sector straddle the start of the index pulse. For emulation to work
properly all the data must be read consecutively. Set this parameter
to the time in nanoseconds the first physical sector is delayed from
the index pulse.  It is needed for Corvus model H and NorthStar
Advantage drives.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When this program is run it appends to
logfile.txt in the current directory. It logs when it started,
stopped, how long it was executing,  maximum seek time, minimum free
buffers, and how many seeks and writes were done. The shutdown time
is from when the program was told to shut down to the emulation file
closed and written to storage. The operating system will take about 5
more seconds to shut down.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If the log file minimum free buffers is
zero you may wish to either increase the number of buffers or maximum
delay. If the log file shutdown time is close to capacitor holdup
time or not all the message were written to the log file the number
of buffers should be decreased or wait 45 seconds after significant
write activity before powering off the MFM emulator.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Example:</p>

</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in">I have found that
if unrecoverable read errors occur operating the drive in a different
orientation may allow the data to be read. I have also had some luck
especially on Seagate drives with pushing on the shaft of the head
stepper motor while it is retrying. This seems to get the head at a
slightly different position where it can read the data. This has a
risk of drive damage so make sure you have read as much as you can
before trying this.</p>
